## To a future Capstone Team,
Thank you for reading through our handoff documentation! UCHI was a student-driven project at the start of 2022 â€“ we know how it feels to not have a single idea about what your Capstone project should be! Through our experience, we realized past teamsâ€™ projects are a great place to start. Inspired by the example and work of others, we put lots of effort into creating a detailed handoff documentation for a team interested in picking up on our work. Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to any of us! We are here to support you in building on UCHIâ€™s foundation! ðŸ˜Š

Best wishes,

Ariane, Rachel, John-Luke, & Ratul
